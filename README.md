# BikeRent
Web application project made as part of the laboratory from the subject 'Databases 2' at Nicolaus Copernicus University. In summary, it is a bicycle rental website.

The functionality of this application is not extensive, but it meets the main requirements. You can:
#
    -Create an account
    -Register or Login to an account
    -Modify account's data
    -Delete an account
    -Rent a Bike
    -Give the bike back
    -Filter the bikes by name or their wheels' size
The app uses MongoDB because it's the database program we use at the laboratory right now. 
The reason it's made old-fashioned (didn't use Spring framework) way is to resemble MongoDB queries as much as possible.
